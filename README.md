# 🏥 Healthcare Process Improvement – Plympton Park Day & Night Surgery (PPDNS)

**University of South Australia – Group 5 | Business Process Management Project (2025)**

---

## 📋 Overview

This project presents a **Business Process Analysis and Improvement Plan** for *Plympton Park Day & Night Surgery* in Adelaide, South Australia.
The clinic operates under a contractor-based business model, providing infrastructure, billing systems, and support services to General Practitioners (GPs).

The project focused on two critical business processes:

1. **Appointment Booking Process**
2. **Patient Attendance Process**

Through stakeholder interviews and BPMN 2.0 modelling, the team identified operational inefficiencies, system dependencies, and digital bottlenecks, proposing automation-based improvements aligned with Lean Healthcare and BPM principles.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Map and analyse **AS-IS** clinical workflows using BPMN 2.0
* Identify inefficiencies such as **system downtime**, **manual data entry**, and **third-party dependency**
* Design **TO-BE** models with improved automation and process integration
* Provide cost-benefit and risk analysis to support managerial decision-making

---

## 🧩 Methodology

* Conducted a semi-structured interview with **Practice Manager – Zeeshan Khan**
* Modelled processes in **BPMN 2.0**
* Applied Lean and process optimisation frameworks
* Performed **Gap Analysis** between AS-IS and TO-BE workflows
